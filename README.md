# Tutorial: Quick Start Guide of Kaggle, Machine Learning Competitions, with Python

This repository contains materials and source codes of a tutorial named “Quick Start Guide of Kaggle, Machine Learning Competitions, with Python” in [Scipy Japan 2020](https://www.scipyjapan.scipy.org/) held on October 30.

## Abstract

In the recent high-profile machine learning competition platform Kaggle, data scientists from all over the world are using Python to build machine learning models.
In this hands-on tutorial, you'll learn the basics of machine learning and Kaggle by running the Notebook-style source codes.
The objective is to help participants learn how to fight and learn with Kaggle using Python.
The [Speaker](https://www.kaggle.com/sishihara) won first place in [a Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction), hosted a [Kaggle Days Tokyo](https://kaggledays.com/events/tokyo2019/) competition, and published [a technical book for beginners](https://www.kspub.co.jp/book/detail/5190067.html).

## Prerequisites

Login to [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/).
If you don’t have an account, please create the account.
Be careful that you can’t change your Kaggle ID after registration.
Kaggle ID is different from display name.
For example, [my Kaggle ID](https://www.kaggle.com/sishihara) is ‘sishihara’ which can’t be changed and the display name is ‘u++’ which can be changed in your profile page.
