# Quick Start Guide of Kaggle: Machine Learning Competitions with Python

This repository contains materials and source code of a tutorial named “Quick Start Guide of Kaggle: Machine Learning Competitions with Python” (Pythonで機械学習コンペティション「Kaggle」をはじめよう) in [Scipy Japan 2020](https://www.scipyjapan.scipy.org/), held on October 30.

## Abstract

In the recent high-profile machine learning competition platform known as Kaggle, data scientists from all over the world are using Python to build machine learning models.
In this hands-on tutorial, you'll learn the basics of machine learning and Kaggle by running the Notebook-style source code.
The objective is to help participants learn how to compete and learn with Kaggle using Python.
The [Speaker](https://www.kaggle.com/sishihara) won first place in [a Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction), hosted a [Kaggle Days Tokyo](https://kaggledays.com/events/tokyo2019/) competition, and published [a technical book for beginners](https://www.kspub.co.jp/book/detail/5190067.html).

## Prerequisites

Log in to [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/).
If you don’t have an account, please create the account.
Be careful because unlike your display name, you can’t change your Kaggle ID after registration.
Your Kaggle ID is different from your display name.
For example, [my Kaggle ID](https://www.kaggle.com/sishihara) is ‘sishihara’ which can’t be changed and the display name is ‘u++’ which can be changed in your profile page.
